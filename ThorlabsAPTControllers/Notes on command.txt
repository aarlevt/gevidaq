MGMSG_MOT_MOVE_ABSOLUTE

Example: Move the motor associated with chan 2 to 10 mm:
TX 53, 04, 06, 00, A2(destination 'or' 0x80, 0x50 'or' 0x80 which is A2 for example), 01(source is host), (01, 00, channel id, 10, 00 for chan1)
 40, 0D, 03, 00, u16bit for length, In the BBD10X series controllers the encoder resolution is 20,000 counts per mm, therefore to set an absolute move
distance of 100 mm, set this parameter to 2,000,000

MGMSG_HW_DISCONNECT

TX 02, 00, 00, 00, 50, 01
